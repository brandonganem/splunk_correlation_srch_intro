== What is a Correlation Search?

I like to think of Correlation Searches are regular saved searches with addtional scaffolding added.


== Brainstorming // Correlation Search Ideas

Reasons for creating a Correlation Search:

* Replace an existing Correlation Search with one tailored for the environment
* Additional alerting an organization's strength's and weaknesses
** Leaverage good visability on endpoints to aid lack of visability on the network
* Application 

<<<<

For this presentation I'll be working walking through the steps to replace the built in "Access - Brute Force Access Behavior Detected - Rule" search that Splunk Enterprise Security ships with.
If I'm being honest, I've never been much of a fan of this search and I've heard others have the same complaint, so let's come up with something better.

<<<<

The built in correlation search isn't particuarly smart.
A generous reading of what the search could go something like so:

"Detects excessive number of failed login attempts along with a successful attempt (this could indicate a successful brute force attack)"

[%step]
** Yes, I swiped that from the description.

[%step]
A less generous reading:

This search simply counts the number of successes and failures by user and compares the number of failures to an extreme search context.
There is no concept of time order, just the requirement of some number of failures plus one or more successes.
So long as the number of failures is greater than the threshold set by the Extreme Search context, a notable event is created.

In my expereince that isn't useful.

=== Some alternatives
* A number of failures followed by a success within a timespan
* User account spraying
* Password spraying

Some more advanced ideas

* Admin account logged into a new system, followed by many login attempts by that account
** Maybe expand this to lessor privledged users too?
** For a good datasource here, check out special group auditing in Windows (it's pretty neat)
* Executable mimetype download followed by an authentication spike

While these examples are focused on authentication, I think it's pretty clear how they can be expanded to other datasources.

== Entry into Content Management

== Drilldown Creation

The goal of a useful drilldown is to direct your analysts to additional relevent information.
With this in mind I don't find it to be particuarly useful to just dump an analyst to information nearly identical to what's in the notable event.
With that said, a link to raw events can work in a pinch.

<<<<

With drilldown searches there are two main options to bring data back to the analyst:
* A | datamodel search
** Pro - Raw events!
** Con - Typically really slow
* A | tstats search
** Pro - Really quick
** Con - No raw events here, we're working with the fields within the datamodel itself

In some circumstances, you're working with data outside a datamodel, so a more traditional SPL search can make sense here.

== Extra Credit

=== Extreme Search!

Anything that's a static threshold or stdv can typically be converted into an Extreme Search context.
You can control how the context is generated and updated, giving you a self learning threshold on your searches.
